  <h2>Assessment Objectives</h2>

  <p>
    This project provides an opportunity to demonstrate and apply the DevOps skills developed throughout the
    micro-credential <strong>Introduction to DevOps</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    It simulates a real-world workflow where you will evaluate, enhance, and extend an existing DevOps pipeline.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this project, you will build upon the foundational practical exercises completed in the DevOps learning
    materials and labs, applying best practices in <strong>version control</strong>, <strong>testing</strong>,
    <strong>automation</strong>, and <strong>container deployment</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project emphasizes understanding the full lifecycle of <strong>Continuous Integration (CI)</strong> and
    <strong>Continuous Deployment (CD)</strong> using modern tools such as <strong>GitHub Actions</strong>,
    <strong>Jest</strong>, and <strong>Docker</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>This assessment consolidates key concepts, including:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Effective use of Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration</li>
    <li>Integration of static analysis tools to identify and fix code quality issues</li>
    <li>Implementation of unit testing using Jest to ensure code reliability</li>
    <li>Configuration and extension of a CI/CD pipeline to automate builds, tests, and deployments</li>
