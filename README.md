Assessment Objectives

This project provides an opportunity to demonstrate and apply the DevOps skills developed throughout the micro-credential Introduction to DevOps.
It simulates a real-world workflow where you will evaluate, enhance, and extend an existing DevOps pipeline.
In this project, you will build upon the foundational practical exercises completed in the DevOps learning materials and labs, applying best practices in version control, testing, automation, and container deployment.

The project emphasizes understanding the full lifecycle of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) using modern tools such as GitHub Actions, Jest, and Docker.


This assessment consolidates key concepts, including:
•	Effective use of Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration

•	Integration of static analysis tools to identify and fix code quality issues

•	Implementation of unit testing using Jest to ensure code reliability

•	Configuration and extension of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline to automate builds, tests, and deployment processes

•	Building and deploying Docker images through GitHub Actions to Docker Hub
